# Verifying Fortnite

Verifying Fortnite will revert any modified files in the paks folder to the original state. If there are any files in the paks folder that were **added** these files will not be removed.

There are 2 ways to verify Fortnite. You can either verify it from Pro Swapper or verify it from Epic Games Launcher. Verifying Fortnite from Pro Swapper is more recommended so it resets all your settings of converted items.

1. Open Pro Swapper
2. Click `Settings`
3. Click `Reset Fortnite`

This will open [Epic Games Launcher](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/download) and Fortnite will start verifying.

The second way to Verify Fortnite is through Epic Games Launcher itself. Tutorial here:
