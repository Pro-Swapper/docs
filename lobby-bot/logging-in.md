# Logging In

### What is the authorization code?

When opening the lobby bot for the first time (`ProSwapper_LobbyBot.exe`) it will ask you to enter an authorization code. This authorization code is used to login to the Fortnite account of the bot. You can get your authorization code [here](https://www.epicgames.com/id/logout?redirectUrl=https%3A//www.epicgames.com/id/login%3FredirectUrl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.epicgames.com%252Fid%252Fapi%252Fredirect%253FclientId%253D3446cd72694c4a4485d81b77adbb2141%2526responseType%253Dcode) by logging in to the desired Epic Games account which the bot will use.

### What Epic Games account do I login with the bot?

This can be any Fortnite account, preferably an alternative account to your main. The account can be a brand new Epic Games account. You can make a new Epic Games account [here](https://www.epicgames.com/id/register).
