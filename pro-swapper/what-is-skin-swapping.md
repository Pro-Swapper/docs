# What is Skin Swapping?

Fortnite skin swapping is editing Fortnite's game files to get a different skin/backbling/emote/pickaxe/etc.



In Pro Swapper, there's 2 types of swapping. There is swapping items ingame and swapping items in lobby.

Ingame swapping shows your skin ingame but **only** to yourself and not others.

Lobby swapping shows to others but **only** in the lobby.



You _can_ swap in lobby and ingame at the same time and other will be able to see your skin in lobby but only **you** will see it ingame.
