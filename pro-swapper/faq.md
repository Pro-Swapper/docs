* **Does Pro Swapper work on GeForce Now?**

GeForce Now is Nvidia's "[Cloud Gaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud\_gaming)" service, this plays **Fortnite** on another PC so you're playing Fortnite on a computer which isn't yours, which means you cannot install third party programs/software such as Pro Swapper.

* **Why can't other people see my skin?**

If you're using the lobby swapper, other people will be able to see your skin in lobby.

If you're using an ingame swapper, the swapper is client sided which means that only you are able to see it because of the way that Fortnite processes skin data.

The swapper is only available for Windows. (Most recommended on Windows 10/11)
