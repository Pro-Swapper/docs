# Fortnite Crashing/Kicking

{% hint style="warning" %}
When using emotes DO NOT put the emote in your main locker wheel, favorite it instead so you don't get kicked out of the game.
{% endhint %}

If Fortnite is crashing / not opening you can try [verifying Fortnite](verifying-fortnite.md) then swapping the item(s) you want.

{% hint style="danger" %}
* **If you get this error it means you swapped too many items**
{% endhint %}

#### There is no real maximum numbers of items you can swap but it's good to keep it around 1-2, some items together are more likely to kick, you can try and experiment to see what kicks and doesn't kick.

{% hint style="warning" %}
When swapping the `OG Pump` you must swap it by itself without anything else or otherwise it will kick.
{% endhint %}
