# Unreal Engine Crash Message

Fortnite crashes because of the item you **swap it with**. Try swapping your cosmetic for a different item. Arctic Adeline and Sled Ready Guff are common skins that always work.&#x20;

Before swapping again it's recommend to go to **Settings** and press [**Force Remove Swaps**](verifying-fortnite.md)****
