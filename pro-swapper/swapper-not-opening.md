# Swapper Not Opening



{% hint style="warning" %}
First of all, please make sure you downloaded Pro Swapper from the [linkvertise download](https://up-to-down.net/86737/proswapper)

The filename should be `Pro_Swapper.exe`, if Pro Swapper came in a zip file or a file you extract then it's a fake Pro Swapper, we recommend you delete it and do a virus scan on your PC using [Windows Security](https://youtu.be/ZSoaPn7moC0) or [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/).
{% endhint %}

After confirming you have a real Pro Swapper downloaded try the following steps.

* Install Microsoft's [.NET 5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-5.0.10-windows-x64-installer)
* Turn off any anti viruses you have including [Windows Security](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-off-defender-antivirus-protection-in-windows-security-99e6004f-c54c-8509-773c-a4d776b77960).
* Try opening the swapper as Administrator by right clicking `Pro_Swapper.exe` and clicking `Run as administrator`
* Try moving Pro Swapper into a new folder
* If you get a network error when opening Pro Swapper such as a 404, try using a [vpn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual\_private\_network). [Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com/) is a good free vpn.
* Try turning off your [firewall](https://youtu.be/dlBgoVMXIWo)
